An analysis of transactional data collected. The data to be analysed is for the year 2019, to generate report to help find new opportunities to drive more sales and work efficiently.

## **Questions**

1. How much money did we make this year? 

2. Can we identify any seasonality in the  sales? 

3. What are our best and worst-selling products? 

4. How do sales compare to previous months or weeks? 

5. Which cities are our products delivered to most? 

6. How do product categories compare in revenue generated and quantities  ordered? 

7. You are required to show additional details from your findings in your data.

*NB: Products with unit prices above $99.99 should be labelled high-level products  otherwise they should be basic level.*
